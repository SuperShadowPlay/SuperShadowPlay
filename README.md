# Hi! I'm Trevor Corcoran
Software Developer | IBM Mainframe Analyst | Open-Source Enthusiast

## About Me

I'm a Senior Computer Science student at [VCU](https://www.vcu.edu/), passionate about building software that is useful, entertaining, and/or befuddling. I am always seeking new opportunities and building projects that bring joy into the world, or ones that at least solve a piddling annoyance. I'm a proud [Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/) user and have been programming since middle school.

### Career

## Projects
